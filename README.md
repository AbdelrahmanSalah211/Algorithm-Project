### First Problem
Given a set of N jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a
time. We earn the profit associated with job if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit. Jobs will be
given in the form (Jobid, Deadline, Profit) associated with that Job.
### Second Problem
You are given a list of N jobs with their start time, end time, and the profit you can earn by doing that job. Your task is to find the maximum profit you can earn
by picking up some (or all) jobs, ensuring no two jobs overlap. If you choose a job that ends at time X, you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.
